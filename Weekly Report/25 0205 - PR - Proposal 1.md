# Main Point
- 我想要專注於把PSE放進AR中的研究，他可能會是個在AR中的全新研究領域
	- 我還需要再多看輪文驗證一下是否有做的意義
# Outline
- I mentioned one thought in the last meeting, about moving point of subjective equality dynamically while the user turning head.
	- What is that ? I could give you a short review.
- However, I think it is too engineering-oriented rather than the academic perspective. Therefore, I changed the content of my proposal.
	- Give the proposal and their reference.
	- backup plan
		- One problem is that these thought are strongly related to the future works in that paper, so these works may be done by them in this year. Therefore, I tried to redirect myself. I searched for the keywords PSE and VR in Google Scholar, and I found that papers talking about these two keywords at the same time are really rare and no AR/MR paper related to PSE in my searching result these days. So maybe, we can focus on PSE in AR, that maybe a new and good direction of AR works.
