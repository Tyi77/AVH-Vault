# Main Point
- 我想要專注於把PSE放進AR中的研究，他可能會是個在AR中的全新研究領域
	- 我還需要再多看輪文驗證一下是否有做的意義
# Outline
- I mentioned one thought in the last meeting, about moving point of subjective equality dynamically while the user turning head.
	- What is that ? I could give you a short review.
- However, I think it is too engineering-oriented rather than the academic perspective. Therefore, I changed the content of my proposal.
	- Give the proposal and their reference.
	- backup plan
		- One problem is that these thought are strongly related to the future works in that paper, so these works may be done by them in this year. Therefore, I tried to redirect myself. I searched for the keywords PSE and VR in Google Scholar, and I found that papers talking about these two keywords at the same time are really rare and no AR/MR paper related to PSE in my searching result these days. So maybe, we can focus on PSE in AR, that maybe a new and good direction of AR works.
# Feedback from Prof. Lin
## 研究部分
- 題目的每個細節都要去探討是否可做
	- 單個source和多個source
	- 頭的轉速真的有意義嗎？
		- 去察看人的平均頭轉速度
	- PSE 真的有意義嗎？
- 研究的大方向要顧到，而不要一直去鑽小方向
- 這個主題可能跟navigation比較有關
## 報告部分
- 報告呈現方式是要「選擇題」而不要「申論題」
	- 針對事情做評價，而不是完全的自由發想
- 報告的時長要再更短
- 口語的準確度要再更高
- PPT 上的英文要更地道
