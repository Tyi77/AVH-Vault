# Introduction
- 許多人都用 Bayesian Statistics 來對照 cue combination
- interaction prior
	- 視覺刺激和聽覺刺激彼此接近的可能性，越高代表兩者越接近，越低代表兩者沒什麼關係
- This model makes three important predictions: 
	1. It predicts the circumstances under which subjects should perceive a common cause or independent causes. 
	2. It predicts if the individual cues should be fused or if they should be processed separately.
	3. It predicts how the cues are combined if they are combined. Here we test the predictions of the model and analyze how well it predicts human behavior.
