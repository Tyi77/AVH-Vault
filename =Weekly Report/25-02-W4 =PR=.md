- Why PSE...
	- First, give you a direct answer. There is no explanation in the paper talking about why the value is negative here. Instead, there are two features you can found in the figure.
	- In the paper, they talk about Stationary and Pursuing modes together because the head is relatively stationary to the visual stimuli in both of them.
	- One of the features is the value of PSE is close to the area occupied by the visual stimulus. It suggests that there is no spatial disparities in the perception of audio-visual stimuli in these conditions.
	- The other one is the width between DT25% and DT75% is narrow. That reveals the high sensitivity to slight misalignment in these conditions.
