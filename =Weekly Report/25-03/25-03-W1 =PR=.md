# Last Meeting's Review
- Talk about the Pesudo Haptics
# Current Progress
- Understand what is Pseudo Haptics
- Still reviewing the survey paper, with a focus on the spatially related section.

- VR vs AR
- physical pegs - haptics, virtual- vision
- 17cm - 18cm
- labortory
- one condition: no haptics - only virtual
- spatial updating research.
- angular offset between perceived and actual location.
- close loop and open loop, perception.
- depth and distance perception.
---
- Definition: A perceptual illusion where visual and auditory stimuli create a sense of touch without physical force feedback.
- mass perception, stiffness perception, friction perception, and so on.
- Project
	- I focus the spatial problem from that project.
	- grisp two bottles on your two hands
	- displacement between the virtual hands and their original positions
	- compare the weight
		- The work finds that The greater the displacement, the heavier the mass feels
- C/D ratio
	- Speed ratio between the finger or the hand or the pointer, that is the control side, and the object or the virtual hand that is the display side.
	- Equal to 1, the speed of the display side will be the same as the control side.
	- greater than 1, the display side will be faster than the control side.
	- less than 1, 
	- salience
