- depth information
- 3d -> 2d images
- Quantification
- density of the fog : extinction coefficient
	- attenuate
	- visibility
	- particle / volume ratio
- cloud simulation
- motivation
	- light/strong snow simulation
- scattering of the fog particles
- density(particles in the volume), color of the targets(contrast), emit/no-emit, what proportion is occluded by the fog.
	- proportion is occluded by the fog: one part of the target
- Targets
	- Colors
