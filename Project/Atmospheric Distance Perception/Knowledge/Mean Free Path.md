- This seems pretty simple. The intensity of a light beam falls by a factor of **1/e** ($e^{-1}$) for every distance **l** it travels, where **l** depends on the density and opacity.
	- $-s/l = -1\ =>\ s = l$
- Hmmm. That seems like a reasonable way to define a mean free path. Let's call **l** the mean free path of a light ray.
