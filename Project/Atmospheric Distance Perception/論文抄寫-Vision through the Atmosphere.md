## I. Introduction.
The distance at which a given object can be seen through the atmosphere is a function of three variables: (1) The optical properties of the atmosphere. (2) the properties of the object itself and of its background, and (3) the state of adaptation of the eyes of the observer. If the object of regard is a source of light, the luminous intensity (candlepower) of the light source is the property implied by the second variable.
It will be the purpose of this article to present a summary of our knowledge of the optical properties of the atmosphere as they affect vision, to summarize the pertinent properties of the eye, and to show how this knowledge may be used to predict the visual range of a given object or source of light. The instruments used to measure the appropriate properties of the properties of the atmosphere will be classified and briefly described; and in addition, a short account will be given of the effect of the atmosphere on the apparent colors of objects and lights.
