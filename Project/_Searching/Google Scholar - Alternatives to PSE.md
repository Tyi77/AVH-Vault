#### For "Binomial Regression":
1. **Logistic Regression** (when referring to binary outcome modeling)
2. **Binary Logistic Regression**
3. **Generalized Linear Model (GLM) with Logit Link**
4. **Probit Regression** (if using a probit link instead of a logit link)
5. **Dichotomous Outcome Regression**
6. **Bernoulli Regression**
7. **Categorical Regression** (if expanding to multinomial cases)
8. **Logit Model**
9. **Binary Response Model**
10. **Threshold Model** (if emphasizing decision thresholds)
#### For "Point of Subjective Equality (PSE)":
1. **Perceptual Equivalence Point**
2. **Perceived Equality Threshold**
3. **Subjective Matching Point**
4. **Just-Perceptible Equivalence**
5. **Psychophysical Equivalence Point**
6. **Perceptual Threshold for Equality**
7. **Equal Perceptual Judgment Point**
8. **Perceived Balance Point**
9. **Cognitive Equivalence Threshold**
10. **Sensory Decision Point**
