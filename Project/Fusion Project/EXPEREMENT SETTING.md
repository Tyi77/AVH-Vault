## Experiment Environment
- A semicircular arrangement of objects, each producing distinct pitches, similar to a xylophone.
## RQ
- How do users perceive the location of the objects when the visual, auditory, and haptic stimuli are spatially displaced?
	- We can use PSE to model this problem.
## Other thoughts
- Comparing different experiment settings in VR and MR
- We can merge different research areas.
	- spatial updating, perceptuomotor calibration, spatial localization, depth perception, perception-action with avatars in XR (VR, AR, MR)**
