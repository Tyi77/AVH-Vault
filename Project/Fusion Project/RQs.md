“How do the aspects of avatarization, the physicality of interacting components, and interaction techniques used affect near-field mixed reality interactions?”
**H1**: Interacting with physical pegs will result in lower accuracy. 
**H2**: The avatar-gain representation will perform worse in terms of efficiency and accuracy. 
**H3**: Using the Pinch-to-grasp technique will result in higher accuracy, efficiency, and perceived usability. 
**H4**: Users will perceive interactions to be more usable with an avatar than without. 
**H5**: Users will improve their accuracy and efficiency over trials.
